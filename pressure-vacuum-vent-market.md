<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pressure Vacuum Vent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure Only</li><li>Vacuum Only</li><li>Combined Pressure/Vacuum Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Pressure Vacuum Vent market comprises three main types: Pressure Only, Vacuum Only, and Combined Pressure/Vacuum Valves. Pressure Only vents allow gases to escape when internal pressure exceeds a set limit, preventing tank rupture. Vacuum Only vents enable the influx of air to maintain equilibrium without allowing external contaminants. Combined Pressure/Vacuum Valves serve both functions, releasing excess pressure and allowing air intake under vacuum conditions. Each type plays a crucial role in ensuring safety and efficiency in storage and processing systems.</p></p>
